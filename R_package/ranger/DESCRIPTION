Description: Ranger is a fast implementation of Random Forests, particularly suited for high dimensional
           data. For now, ensembles of classification, regression and survival trees are supported. With
           Ranger data from Genome-wide association (GWA) studies can be analyzed efficiently. In
           addition to data frames, datasets of class 'gwaa.data' (R package GenABEL) can be directly
           analyzed.
